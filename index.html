<p> These 3-dimensional, interactive maps are visualizations of <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/">USGS</a> earthquake data files, they are not models.  Raluca Nicola created a visualization for <a href="https://ralucanicola.github.io/earthquakes-viz/">earthquakes</a> which creates a 3 dimensional map of earthquakes on Earth's globe. The visualizations can be adapted to visualize the entire globe or any region of the Earth using any .csv file from the USGS database. The orange lines represent the boundaries of the tectonic plates. Earthquake data from
        <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/">USGS</a>.

        is made available by the <a href="https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/">Living Atlas</a>. Visualization created
        with <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript">Esri's ArcGIS API for JavaScript</a>.</p>

      <div id="legend">
        Earthquakes are marked by yellow or green spheres, and red spheres for larger earthquakes. Maps with volcanoes also have red spheres at the surface representing the volcanoes, there is one map including the mantle core boundary outlined by white spheres. Depending on the density of earthquakes of each individual visualization, the color and size of spheres are interpolated. The visualizations are limited by the USGS to less than 20,000 earthquakes. For regional earthquake maps the earthquakes may not be initially evident because the region visualized is on the other side of the Earth globe. Once the globe starts to revolve it indicates that the earthquake data has been loaded and you can turn to the region listed in the title. 

The toggle button initially exaggerates the Earthquake depth by a factor of 6. This can act like a magnifying glass or it can be distracting and can be disabled to visualize the earthquakes in their exact location in the Earth's globe.
